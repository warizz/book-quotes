>The basic rule, which has been repeated by many programmers and with which I wholeheartedly agree,  
is to not worry about efficiency until you know for sure that the program is too slow.
If it is, find out which parts are taking up the most time, and start exchanging elegance for efficiency in those parts.

>A useful principle is not to add cleverness unless you are absolutely sure you’re going to need it.
It can be tempting to write general “frameworks” for every little bit of functionality you come across. Resist that urge. You won’t get any real work done, and you’ll end up writing a lot of code that no one will ever use.
