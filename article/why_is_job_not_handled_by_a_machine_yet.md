# Why is this job not handled by a machine yet?

>It is worth noting that my more pleasant experiences with machines are not unique. Nuanced Enterprises found in a recent study that 67 percent people prefer self-service machines.

>Add to that, the cost savings for implementing these machines is huge. Check-ins with a human agent cost the airline about $3 each; that cost drops to $0.14 with the mobile check-in machines. According to the International Air Transport Association, moving to a fully automated check-in process could save the airline industry $1.6 billion a year. Which raises the question: Why haven’t we?

>Not only can automated systems offer companies cost savings, it can actually help them make more money. An experiment at McDonald’s found that customers using self-service kiosks were more likely to supersize their orders, resulting in an average increase of $0.30 per order. It appears customers ordering from a human were more self-conscious of the employee’s judgment, which I found shocking. People who are eating at McDonald’s still care what people think of them? I have always thought of it as the devil-may-care restaurant choice.

...

>It is hard to square this circle mentally until we look at the demographics of the 33 percent of people (the leftovers from the Nuance study above) who don’t prefer self-service machines. The most telling metric is age. Suffice it to say, this is the 33 percent of society most likely to call their grandchildren to ask what tweeting means.

>Unfortunately for the rest of us, that 33 percent is also generally the voting majority of board members for most big companies. This gives more clarity to the selective reluctance of certain companies to implement machines into their workflow. Frankly, if I needed to gain approval from my grandfather for every technology purchase I wanted to make, I would be writing this article on a typewriter and calling it in to my editor on a rotary phone.
