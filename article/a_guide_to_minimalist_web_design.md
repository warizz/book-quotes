>Choose one, take it away, if the design remains to work the way it should, throw that element out because it is not absolutely required, if not keep it.
In other term, don’t add elements just for their own sake.

>## How can I reach Minimalism in my design?
- Limit your purposes: Choice isn’t always good, pare down decisions and clear your design. If you want to create a website, try to give it one single purpose, with one call to action.
- Limit your resources: Reducing the number of colors, fonts, sizes… will make the design feel consistent, and force you to focus more on the real problem.
- Find your important element, and put it above all other elements.
- Don’t just throw out elements, think about your users’ needs and try to make tasks as simple as possible.
- Focus on details because they are important to the overall look and feel of the website when the elements are few.
