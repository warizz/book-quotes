>I grabbed a cheap Airbnb in a small town on the Oregon coast to conserve costs, and started looking for contracts. Main method: Talking to *lots and lots and lots* of people. Oddly enough, most of my "looking for contracts" wasn't screaming "I need work!" I learned quickly that the best way to get a deal was to listen to the other person and help them first-- this also just feels more human. And then they might not have work for you, they might not even have any leads, but if you do that they're probably happy to connect you to someone else. Sometimes after months a person I'd helped would get back to me, "Hey, I appreciated what you did for me. Here's a lead I found." and that'd turn into a huge deal. Give and take. After a couple months, I'd secured some lucrative contract deals and countless leads.

>So anyway, we started building the product and I started shifting my "talk to lots of people" efforts to focus on the product. Rich also started blogging about the tech details a lot. We no longer mentioned contract work when talking to people, only the product. The "give first, take later" approach continued to work really well (and also just felt like the right way to live). Our most successful publicity attempts always sprung out of helping others-- we did several community workshops, mentored lots of people, helped people find jobs, etc. As time went on, we also got more invitations to speak about the product at events and conferences.
